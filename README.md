However, Some unknown event caused all the humans to die, But the player. It seems that after that horrible event, The history started to repeat itself every time all the humans, Including the player died. This seems to be alterable through changing history in a way that the player does not die by killing themselves. The creator of "A Wonderland" cursed the place for everybody to die to that event over and over again, Unless the player goes into their grave rather than killing themselves.
